## Discounts - Cloudoki

By Rafael G. Couto <rafaelgcouto@gmail.com>

## Developed work

In order to develop this practical test, I've implemented a Laravel package with everything necessary to handle the discounts tasks
proposed by the Cloudoki team.

## Installation

TODO


## Discounts configuration

In the config folder of the package it is possible to find a discount criterion configuration file.

In this file there are 3 discount types pre-configured:
- [discountPercentageByRevenue] A customer who has already bought for over â‚¬ 1000, gets a discount of 10% on the whole order.
- [freeByAmountOfItemsOfSameCategory] For every products of category "Switches" (id 2), when you buy five, you get a sixth for free.
- [percentageOnCheapestByAmountOfItemsOfSameCategory] If you buy two or more products of category "Tools" (id 1), you get a 20% discount on the cheapest product.

It is possible to add more discounts, just follow the instructions in the criterion.json file.
